Visualization 1: The line graph displays the relationship between size of each
volunteer activity hosted by Boston Cares with the review from the volunteers.
The volunteers were asked to answer a series of questions, rating from 1 to 5,
after completion. The line graph can be explored using either a dropdown bar or
a button to display different datasets.
